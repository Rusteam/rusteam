# Hi there

My name is Rustem Glue. I am a deep learning researcher and engineer. 
I have experience working with structured machine learning problems and
text and image processing with deep learning. 
Currently I'm working on appling deep learning models to SAR imagery. I've trained:
- an object detection model to localize multiple object classes
- a segmentation model to recognize environmental issues.
